An in-game mod manager for Guilty Gear -Strive-. Source code can be found at https://github.com/WistfulHopes/UE4SSMods/tree/master/GGSTModManager.

Thanks to @trumank for making the PakReloader mod, which this is based on. The original mod can be found at https://github.com/trumank/RE-UE4SS/tree/mods/mods/pak_reloader.

## Installation
- Extract into GUILTY GEAR STRIVE\RED\Binaries\Win64. You should see a new folder called `ue4ss`, as well as a new file called `dwmapi.dll`.

## Uninstallation
- Remove `dwmapi.dll`.

## Usage
- Toggle the menu with F1 on your keyboard.
- Set the mods folder to wherever you store mods (for example, your Strive folder in Unverum).
- Press Reload Mods at the bottom to save the mod configuration and reload mods immediately.
- Press Save Changes to save all mod changes *without* immediately reloading mods.
